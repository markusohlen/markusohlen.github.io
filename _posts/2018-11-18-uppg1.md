I think there are both pros and cons with pre-complied css, right now I feel like regular css is better (at least easier to understand) but I can still see the pros with pre-complied css. I used pre-complied css on my website for example I used the variables to change multiple css styles and I nested the code so I don't have to rewrite the code mutiple times.

### Pros and cons with pre-complied css

| Pros                                                      | Cons                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Easy to change multiple css styles at once with variables | Can be difficut to debug the css code   |
| Use calculations                                          | More complex, it's more tools to handle |
| Nesting (less code to write)                              |                                         |


Right now I don't really like static site generator because it just feels more complex than writing your own code. First you have to understand what the author of the code is doing, then you have to implement your own code into his. Static site generator can be good if you only have a static website with only static content.

robots.txt is a file that checks if a robot or bot is entering the website, I have configured it so no bot can access my page.

humans.txt is a file that describes the team who built this website, special thanks to people who helped and some information about the website.

Open graph is used to give the user an overview of what the page contains
